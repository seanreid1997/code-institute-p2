## Design

### Design Choices
While learning how to make a quiz from the Brian Design youtube channel, I liked the design he showed us and the color schemes as well. I kept the blue color for the buttons but decided i wanted a lighter page so I changed the background color to White and the made the headings black instead.

### Fonts
The fonts I used for this project taken from Google fonts.

### Structure
Including the youtube tutorial i looked around at examples of different quiz formats and I decided to keep the standard way of structuring questions and choices for answers.
